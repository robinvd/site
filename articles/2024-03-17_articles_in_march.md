# Aggregation on Information Retrieval (IR)

The first (and maybe only) post in a new series where i note down various interesting media i've found/read/watches recently on a specific topic.
This time on Information Retrieval!

I've had a course in uni about this, and was always interested in the topic. It combines interesting algorithms and structures with lowish level programming.
But in the theory we only discussed indexing using a inverted index. A simple but very powerfull approuch.

## Signature based IR

I dont remember how i found the article [Building a custom code search index in Go for searchcode.com](https://boyter.org/posts/how-i-built-my-own-index-for-searchcode/).
But its a super interesting variant of full text search, using bloom filters instead of inverted indexes!
The advantage of bloom filters is way less memory used, but the answer is probabilistic.
And using bloom filters for IR works the same way.

```python
GLOBAL_VAR = 10
def test():
  pass
  print(10, "test")
  test = r"test"
  test2 = """test"""

@dataclass
class Test(object):
  def func():
    pass
```

```rust
struct Test {}
fn test() {
  println!("123 {}", "test");
}
```
