  notes: "Ive seen his 'links' page before, but this post finally made me add this page you're reading to the site. He only adds the title and link. But i think its more interesting to add some of my own thoughts to it as well. As a sort of micro blog!"

- title: "Lies we tell ourselves to keep using Golang"
  url: "https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang"
  notes: "A series of very critical posts about serious flaws in go, from a language design perspective. While every language has subjective flaws, i think go is one where they went out of their way to make it objectively worse, many of these points listed in the article. A good read even if you like go."
